Snippets from my research in geo-sciences (satellite, etc...), often in python.

## Python
1. [how to compute 2D block averages of numpy arrays](https://github.com/TomLav/snippets/blob/main/Block%20Average%20of%202D%20arrays.ipynb).
2. [how to add Antarctic ice sheets and shelves on a cartopy map](https://github.com/TomLav/snippets/blob/main/Cartopy%20Ice%20Sheet%20and%20Shelves.ipynb).
3. [read a sea-ice concentration file from the OSI SAF / CCI CDRs (over OpenDap)](https://github.com/TomLav/snippets/blob/main/Read%20OSISAF%20CCI%20Sea%20Ice%20Concentration%20CDR.ipynb).

## Science
1. [investigate linear fits when both X and Y have uncertainties](https://github.com/TomLav/snippets/blob/main/Linear%20Fit%20when%20both%20X%20and%20Y%20have%20Uncertainties.ipynb).
2. [investigate pseudo-biases when dealing with the velocity / magnitude of vectors](https://github.com/TomLav/snippets/blob/main/Pseudo-biases%20with%20vector%20velocity.ipynb).

## Miscellaneous
1. [code to reprocude my time diagram of passive microwave satellites](https://github.com/TomLav/snippets/blob/main/CDR%20Satellite%20Diagram%20Public.ipynb).
2. [code to plot the time abstracts are received up-until the deadline](https://github.com/TomLav/snippets/blob/main/Plot%20Abstracts%20Submission.ipynb).
